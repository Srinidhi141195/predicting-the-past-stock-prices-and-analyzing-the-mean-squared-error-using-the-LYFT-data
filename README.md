# predicting-the-past-stock-prices-and-analyzing-the-mean-squared-error-using-the-LYFT-data

Overview:
Recurrent Neural Netowkrs (RNNs) and the application of the time series and the sequential analysis. I have used the LYFT dataset for the 100 days to divide the data into 10 days and to predict the 10th day stock price using the previous 9 days prices. I have used Simple RNN, LSTM and the Conv1d models to predict the stock prices.
